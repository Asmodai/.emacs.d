Writing Emacs Primitives
========================

   Lisp primitives are Lisp functions implemented in C.  The details of
interfacing the C function so that Lisp can call it are handled by a few
C macros.  The only way to really understand how to write new C code is
to read the source, but we can explain some things here.

   An example of a special form is the definition of `or', from
`eval.c'.  (An ordinary function would have the same general
appearance.)

     DEFUN ("or", For, Sor, 0, UNEVALLED, 0,
       "Eval args until one of them yields non-nil; return that value.\n\
     The remaining args are not evalled at all.\n\

     If all args return nil, return nil.")
       (args)
          Lisp_Object args;
     {
       register Lisp_Object val;
       Lisp_Object args_left;
       struct gcpro gcpro1;

     if (NULL (args))
         return Qnil;
     
       args_left = args;
       GCPRO1 (args_left);

     do
         {
           val = Feval (Fcar (args_left));
           if (!NULL (val))
             break;
           args_left = Fcdr (args_left);
         }
       while (!NULL (args_left));

     UNGCPRO;
       return val;
     }

   Let's start with a precise explanation of the arguments to the
`DEFUN' macro.  Here is a template for them:

     DEFUN (LNAME, FNAME, SNAME, MIN, MAX, INTERACTIVE, DOC)

LNAME
     This is the name of the Lisp symbol to define as the function
     name; in the example above, it is `or'.

FNAME
     This is the C function name for this function.  This is the name
     that is used in C code for calling the function.  The name is, by
     convention, `F' prepended to the Lisp name, with all dashes (`-')
     in the Lisp name changed to underscores.  Thus, to call this
     function from C code, call `For'.  Remember that the arguments must
     be of type `Lisp_Object'; various macros and functions for creating
     values of type `Lisp_Object' are declared in the file `lisp.h'.

SNAME
     This is a C variable name to use for a structure that holds the
     data for the subr object that represents the function in Lisp.
     This structure conveys the Lisp symbol name to the initialization
     routine that will create the symbol and store the subr object as
     its definition.  By convention, this name is always FNAME with `F'
     replaced with `S'.

MIN
     This is the minimum number of arguments that the function
     requires.  The function `or' allows a minimum of zero arguments.

MAX
     This is the maximum number of arguments that the function accepts,
     if there is a fixed maximum.  Alternatively, it can be `UNEVALLED',
     indicating a special form that receives unevaluated arguments, or
     `MANY', indicating an unlimited number of evaluated arguments (the
     equivalent of `&rest').  Both `UNEVALLED' and `MANY' are macros.
     If MAX is a number, it may not be less than MIN and it may not be
     greater than seven.

INTERACTIVE
     This is an interactive specification, a string such as might be
     used as the argument of `interactive' in a Lisp function.  In the
     case of `or', it is 0 (a null pointer), indicating that `or'
     cannot be called interactively.  A value of `""' indicates a
     function that should receive no arguments when called
     interactively.

DOC
     This is the documentation string.  It is written just like a
     documentation string for a function defined in Lisp, except you
     must write `\n\' at the end of each line.  In particular, the
     first line should be a single sentence.

   After the call to the `DEFUN' macro, you must write the argument
name list that every C function must have, followed by ordinary C
declarations for the arguments.  For a function with a fixed maximum
number of arguments, declare a C argument for each Lisp argument, and
give them all type `Lisp_Object'.  When a Lisp function has no upper
limit on the number of arguments, its implementation in C actually
receives exactly two arguments: the first is the number of Lisp
arguments, and the second is the address of a block containing their
values.  They have types `int' and `Lisp_Object *'.

   Within the function `For' itself, note the use of the macros
`GCPRO1' and `UNGCPRO'.  `GCPRO1' is used to "protect" a variable from
garbage collection--to inform the garbage collector that it must look
in that variable and regard its contents as an accessible object.  This
is necessary whenever you call `Feval' or anything that can directly or
indirectly call `Feval'.  At such a time, any Lisp object that you
intend to refer to again must be protected somehow.  `UNGCPRO' cancels
the protection of the variables that are protected in the current
function.  It is necessary to do this explicitly.

   For most data types, it suffices to protect at least one pointer to
the object; as long as the object is not recycled, all pointers to it
remain valid.  This is not so for strings, because the garbage collector
can move them.  When the garbage collector moves a string, it relocates
all the pointers it knows about; any other pointers become invalid.
Therefore, you must protect all pointers to strings across any point
where garbage collection may be possible.

   The macro `GCPRO1' protects just one local variable.  If you want to
protect two, use `GCPRO2' instead; repeating `GCPRO1' will not work.
Macros `GCPRO3' and `GCPRO4' also exist.

   These macros implicitly use local variables such as `gcpro1'; you
must declare these explicitly, with type `struct gcpro'.  Thus, if you
use `GCPRO2', you must declare `gcpro1' and `gcpro2'.  Alas, we can't
explain all the tricky details here.

   You must not use C initializers for static or global variables unless
they are never written once Emacs is dumped.  These variables with
initializers are allocated in an area of memory that becomes read-only
(on certain operating systems) as a result of dumping Emacs.  *Note
Pure Storage::.

   Do not use static variables within functions--place all static
variables at top level in the file.  This is necessary because Emacs on
some operating systems defines the keyword `static' as a null macro.
(This definition is used because those systems put all variables
declared static in a place that becomes read-only after dumping, whether
they have initializers or not.)

   Defining the C function is not enough to make a Lisp primitive
available; you must also create the Lisp symbol for the primitive and
store a suitable subr object in its function cell.  The code looks like
this:

     defsubr (&SUBR-STRUCTURE-NAME);

Here SUBR-STRUCTURE-NAME is the name you used as the third argument to
`DEFUN'.

   If you add a new primitive to a file that already has Lisp primitives
defined in it, find the function (near the end of the file) named
`syms_of_SOMETHING', and add the call to `defsubr' there.  If the file
doesn't have this function, or if you create a new file, add to it a
`syms_of_FILENAME' (e.g., `syms_of_myfile').  Then find the spot in
`emacs.c' where all of these functions are called, and add a call to
`syms_of_FILENAME' there.

   The function `syms_of_FILENAME' is also the place to define any C
variables that are to be visible as Lisp variables.  `DEFVAR_LISP'
makes a C variable of type `Lisp_Object' visible in Lisp.  `DEFVAR_INT'
makes a C variable of type `int' visible in Lisp with a value that is
always an integer.  `DEFVAR_BOOL' makes a C variable of type `int'
visible in Lisp with a value that is either `t' or `nil'.

   If you define a file-scope C variable of type `Lisp_Object', you
must protect it for garbage-collection by calling `staticpro' in
`syms_of_FILENAME', like this:

     staticpro (&VARIABLE);

   Here is another example function, with more complicated arguments.
This comes from the code in `window.c', and it demonstrates the use of
macros and functions to manipulate Lisp objects.

     DEFUN ("coordinates-in-window-p", Fcoordinates_in_window_p,
       Scoordinates_in_window_p, 2, 2,
       "xSpecify coordinate pair: \nXExpression which evals to window: ",
       "Return non-nil if COORDINATES is in WINDOW.\n\
     COORDINATES is a cons of the form (X . Y), X and Y being distances\n\
     ...

     If they are on the border between WINDOW and its right sibling,\n\
        `vertical-line' is returned.")
       (coordinates, window)
          register Lisp_Object coordinates, window;
     {
       int x, y;

     CHECK_LIVE_WINDOW (window, 0);
       CHECK_CONS (coordinates, 1);
       x = XINT (Fcar (coordinates));
       y = XINT (Fcdr (coordinates));

     switch (coordinates_in_window (XWINDOW (window), &x, &y))
         {
         case 0:			/* NOT in window at all. */
           return Qnil;

     case 1:			/* In text part of window. */
           return Fcons (make_number (x), make_number (y));

     case 2:			/* In mode line of window. */
           return Qmode_line;

     case 3:			/* On right border of window.  */
           return Qvertical_line;

     default:
           abort ();
         }
     }

   Note that C code cannot call functions by name unless they are
defined in C.  The way to call a function written in Lisp is to use
`Ffuncall', which embodies the Lisp function `funcall'.  Since the Lisp
function `funcall' accepts an unlimited number of arguments, in C it
takes two: the number of Lisp-level arguments, and a one-dimensional
array containing their values.  The first Lisp-level argument is the
Lisp function to call, and the rest are the arguments to pass to it.
Since `Ffuncall' can call the evaluator, you must protect pointers from
garbage collection around the call to `Ffuncall'.

   The C functions `call0', `call1', `call2', and so on, provide handy
ways to call a Lisp function conveniently with a fixed number of
arguments.  They work by calling `Ffuncall'.

   `eval.c' is a very good file to look through for examples; `lisp.h'
contains the definitions for some important macros and functions.

Object Internals
================

   GNU Emacs Lisp manipulates many different types of data.  The actual
data are stored in a heap and the only access that programs have to it
is through pointers.  Pointers are thirty-two bits wide in most
implementations.  Depending on the operating system and type of machine
for which you compile Emacs, twenty-eight bits are used to address the
object, and the remaining four bits are used for a GC mark bit and the
tag that identifies the object's type.

   Because Lisp objects are represented as tagged pointers, it is always
possible to determine the Lisp data type of any object.  The C data type
`Lisp_Object' can hold any Lisp object of any data type.  Ordinary
variables have type `Lisp_Object', which means they can hold any type
of Lisp value; you can determine the actual data type only at run time.
The same is true for function arguments; if you want a function to
accept only a certain type of argument, you must check the type
explicitly using a suitable predicate (*note Type Predicates::.).

Buffer Internals
----------------

   Buffers contain fields not directly accessible by the Lisp
programmer.  We describe them here, naming them by the names used in
the C code.  Many are accessible indirectly in Lisp programs via Lisp
primitives.

`name'
     The buffer name is a string that names the buffer.  It is
     guaranteed to be unique.  *Note Buffer Names::.

`save_modified'
     This field contains the time when the buffer was last saved, as an
     integer.  *Note Buffer Modification::.

`modtime'
     This field contains the modification time of the visited file.  It
     is set when the file is written or read.  Every time the buffer is
     written to the file, this field is compared to the modification
     time of the file.  *Note Buffer Modification::.

`auto_save_modified'
     This field contains the time when the buffer was last auto-saved.

`last_window_start'
     This field contains the `window-start' position in the buffer as of
     the last time the buffer was displayed in a window.

`undo_list'
     This field points to the buffer's undo list.  *Note Undo::.

`syntax_table_v'
     This field contains the syntax table for the buffer.  *Note Syntax
     Tables::.

`downcase_table'
     This field contains the conversion table for converting text to
     lower case.  *Note Case Tables::.

`upcase_table'
     This field contains the conversion table for converting text to
     upper case.  *Note Case Tables::.

`case_canon_table'
     This field contains the conversion table for canonicalizing text
     for case-folding search.  *Note Case Tables::.

`case_eqv_table'
     This field contains the equivalence table for case-folding search.
     *Note Case Tables::.

`display_table'
     This field contains the buffer's display table, or `nil' if it
     doesn't have one.  *Note Display Tables::.

`markers'
     This field contains the chain of all markers that currently point
     into the buffer.  Deletion of text in the buffer, and motion of
     the buffer's gap, must check each of these markers and perhaps
     update it.  *Note Markers::.

`backed_up'
     This field is a flag that tells whether a backup file has been made
     for the visited file of this buffer.

`mark'
     This field contains the mark for the buffer.  The mark is a marker,
     hence it is also included on the list `markers'.  *Note The Mark::.

`mark_active'
     This field is non-`nil' if the buffer's mark is active.

`local_var_alist'
     This field contains the association list describing the
     buffer-local variable bindings of this buffer, not including the
     built-in buffer-local bindings that have special slots in the
     buffer object.  (Those slots are omitted from this table.)  *Note
     Buffer-Local Variables::.

`base_buffer'
     This field holds the buffer's base buffer (if it is an indirect
     buffer), or `nil'.

`keymap'
     This field holds the buffer's local keymap.  *Note Keymaps::.

`overlay_center'
     This field holds the current overlay center position.  *Note
     Overlays::.

`overlays_before'
     This field holds a list of the overlays in this buffer that end at
     or before the current overlay center position.  They are sorted in
     order of decreasing end position.

`overlays_after'
     This field holds a list of the overlays in this buffer that end
     after the current overlay center position.  They are sorted in
     order of increasing beginning position.

`enable_multibyte_characters'
     This field holds the buffer's local value of
     `enable-multibyte-characters'--either `t' or `nil'.


File: elisp,  Node: Window Internals,  Next: Process Internals,  Prev: Buffer Internals,  Up: Object Internals

Window Internals
----------------

   Windows have the following accessible fields:

`frame'
     The frame that this window is on.

`mini_p'
     Non-`nil' if this window is a minibuffer window.

`buffer'
     The buffer that the window is displaying.  This may change often
     during the life of the window.

`dedicated'
     Non-`nil' if this window is dedicated to its buffer.

`pointm'
     This is the value of point in the current buffer when this window
     is selected; when it is not selected, it retains its previous
     value.

`start'
     The position in the buffer that is the first character to be
     displayed in the window.

`force_start'
     If this flag is non-`nil', it says that the window has been
     scrolled explicitly by the Lisp program.  This affects what the
     next redisplay does if point is off the screen: instead of
     scrolling the window to show the text around point, it moves point
     to a location that is on the screen.

`last_modified'
     The `modified' field of the window's buffer, as of the last time a
     redisplay completed in this window.

`last_point'
     The buffer's value of point, as of the last time a redisplay
     completed in this window.

`left'
     This is the left-hand edge of the window, measured in columns.
     (The leftmost column on the screen is column 0.)

`top'
     This is the top edge of the window, measured in lines.  (The top
     line on the screen is line 0.)

`height'
     The height of the window, measured in lines.

`width'
     The width of the window, measured in columns.

`next'
     This is the window that is the next in the chain of siblings.  It
     is `nil' in a window that is the rightmost or bottommost of a
     group of siblings.

`prev'
     This is the window that is the previous in the chain of siblings.
     It is `nil' in a window that is the leftmost or topmost of a group
     of siblings.

`parent'
     Internally, Emacs arranges windows in a tree; each group of
     siblings has a parent window whose area includes all the siblings.
     This field points to a window's parent.

     Parent windows do not display buffers, and play little role in
     display except to shape their child windows.  Emacs Lisp programs
     usually have no access to the parent windows; they operate on the
     windows at the leaves of the tree, which actually display buffers.

`hscroll'
     This is the number of columns that the display in the window is
     scrolled horizontally to the left.  Normally, this is 0.

`use_time'
     This is the last time that the window was selected.  The function
     `get-lru-window' uses this field.

`display_table'
     The window's display table, or `nil' if none is specified for it.

`update_mode_line'
     Non-`nil' means this window's mode line needs to be updated.

`base_line_number'
     The line number of a certain position in the buffer, or `nil'.
     This is used for displaying the line number of point in the mode
     line.

`base_line_pos'
     The position in the buffer for which the line number is known, or
     `nil' meaning none is known.

`region_showing'
     If the region (or part of it) is highlighted in this window, this
     field holds the mark position that made one end of that region.
     Otherwise, this field is `nil'.


File: elisp,  Node: Process Internals,  Prev: Window Internals,  Up: Object Internals

Process Internals
-----------------

   The fields of a process are:

`name'
     A string, the name of the process.

`command'
     A list containing the command arguments that were used to start
     this process.

`filter'
     A function used to accept output from the process instead of a
     buffer, or `nil'.

`sentinel'
     A function called whenever the process receives a signal, or `nil'.

`buffer'
     The associated buffer of the process.

`pid'
     An integer, the Unix process ID.

`childp'
     A flag, non-`nil' if this is really a child process.  It is `nil'
     for a network connection.

`mark'
     A marker indicating the position of the end of the last output
     from this process inserted into the buffer.  This is often but not
     always the end of the buffer.

`kill_without_query'
     If this is non-`nil', killing Emacs while this process is still
     running does not ask for confirmation about killing the process.

`raw_status_low'
`raw_status_high'
     These two fields record 16 bits each of the process status
     returned by the `wait' system call.

`status'
     The process status, as `process-status' should return it.

`tick'
`update_tick'
     If these two fields are not equal, a change in the status of the
     process needs to be reported, either by running the sentinel or by
     inserting a message in the process buffer.

`pty_flag'
     Non-`nil' if communication with the subprocess uses a PTY; `nil'
     if it uses a pipe.

`infd'
     The file descriptor for input from the process.

`outfd'
     The file descriptor for output to the process.

`subtty'
     The file descriptor for the terminal that the subprocess is using.
     (On some systems, there is no need to record this, so the value is
     `nil'.)

`tty_name'
     The name of the terminal that the subprocess is using, or `nil' if
     it is using pipes.

Standard Errors
***************

   Here is the complete list of the error symbols in standard Emacs,
grouped by concept.  The list includes each symbol's message (on the
`error-message' property of the symbol) and a cross reference to a
description of how the error can occur.

   Each error symbol has an `error-conditions' property that is a list
of symbols.  Normally this list includes the error symbol itself and
the symbol `error'.  Occasionally it includes additional symbols, which
are intermediate classifications, narrower than `error' but broader
than a single error symbol.  For example, all the errors in accessing
files have the condition `file-error'.  If we do not say here that a
certain error symbol has additional error conditions, that means it has
none.

   As a special exception, the error symbol `quit' does not have the
condition `error', because quitting is not considered an error.

   *Note Errors::, for an explanation of how errors are generated and
handled.

`SYMBOL'
     STRING; REFERENCE.

`error'
     `"error"'
     *Note Errors::.

`file-already-exists'
     This is a `file-error'.
     *Note Writing to Files::.

`file-date-error'
     This is a subcategory of `file-error'.  It occurs when `copy-file'

`file-error'
     This error and its subcategories do not have error-strings,
     because the error message is constructed from the data items alone
     when the error condition `file-error' is present.
     *Note Files::.

Standard Keymaps
****************

   The following symbols are used as the names for various keymaps.
Some of these exist when Emacs is first started, others are loaded only
when their respective mode is used.  This is not an exhaustive list.

   Almost all of these maps are used as local maps.  Indeed, of the
modes that presently exist, only Vip mode and Terminal mode ever change
the global keymap.

`Buffer-menu-mode-map'
     A full keymap used by Buffer Menu mode.

`c-mode-map'
     A sparse keymap used by C mode.

`command-history-map'
     A full keymap used by Command History mode.

`ctl-x-4-map'
     A sparse keymap for subcommands of the prefix `C-x 4'.

`ctl-x-5-map'
     A sparse keymap for subcommands of the prefix `C-x 5'.

`ctl-x-map'
     A full keymap for `C-x' commands.

`debugger-mode-map'
     A full keymap used by Debugger mode.

`dired-mode-map'
     A full keymap for `dired-mode' buffers.

`edit-abbrevs-map'
     A sparse keymap used in `edit-abbrevs'.

`edit-tab-stops-map'
     A sparse keymap used in `edit-tab-stops'.

`electric-buffer-menu-mode-map'
     A full keymap used by Electric Buffer Menu mode.

`electric-history-map'
     A full keymap used by Electric Command History mode.

`emacs-lisp-mode-map'
     A sparse keymap used by Emacs Lisp mode.

`facemenu-menu'
     The keymap that displays the Text Properties menu.

`facemenu-background-menu'
     The keymap that displays the Background Color submenu of the Text
     Properties menu.

`facemenu-face-menu'
     The keymap that displays the Face submenu of the Text Properties
     menu.

`facemenu-foreground-menu'
     The keymap that displays the Foreground Color submenu of the Text
     Properties menu.

`facemenu-indentation-menu'
     The keymap that displays the Indentation submenu of the Text
     Properties menu.

`facemenu-justification-menu'
     The keymap that displays the Justification submenu of the Text
     Properties menu.

`facemenu-special-menu'
     The keymap that displays the Special Props submenu of the Text
     Properties menu.

`function-key-map'
     The keymap for translating keypad and function keys.
     If there are none, then it contains an empty sparse keymap.  *Note
     Translating Input::.

`fundamental-mode-map'
     The local keymap for Fundamental mode.
     It is empty and should not be changed.

`Helper-help-map'
     A full keymap used by the help utility package.
     It has the same keymap in its value cell and in its function cell.

`Info-edit-map'
     A sparse keymap used by the `e' command of Info.

`Info-mode-map'
     A sparse keymap containing Info commands.

`isearch-mode-map'
     A keymap that defines the characters you can type within
     incremental search.

`key-translation-map'
     A keymap for translating keys.  This one overrides ordinary key
     bindings, unlike `function-key-map'.  *Note Translating Input::.

`lisp-interaction-mode-map'
     A sparse keymap used by Lisp mode.

`lisp-mode-map'
     A sparse keymap used by Lisp mode.

     The keymap which displays the Mule menu in the menu bar.

`menu-bar-search-menu'
     The keymap which displays the Search menu in the menu bar.

`menu-bar-tools-menu'
     The keymap which displays the Tools menu in the menu bar.

`mode-specific-map'
     The keymap for characters following `C-c'.  Note, this is in the
     global map.  This map is not actually mode specific: its name was
     chosen to be informative for the user in `C-h b'
     (`display-bindings'), where it describes the main use of the `C-c'
     prefix key.

`occur-mode-map'
     A local keymap used by Occur mode.

`query-replace-map'
     A local keymap used for responses in `query-replace' and related
     commands; also for `y-or-n-p' and `map-y-or-n-p'.  The functions
     that use this map do not support prefix keys; they look up one
     event at a time.

`text-mode-map'
     A sparse keymap used by Text mode.

`view-mode-map'
     A full keymap used by View mode.

Standard Hooks
**************

   The following is a list of hook variables that let you provide
functions to be called from within Emacs on suitable occasions.

   Most of these variables have names ending with `-hook'.  They are
"normal hooks", run by means of `run-hooks'.  The value of such a hook
is a list of functions; the functions are called with no arguments and
their values are completely ignored.  The recommended way to put a new
function on such a hook is to call `add-hook'.  *Note Hooks::, for more
information about using hooks.

   The variables whose names end in `-hooks' or `-functions' are
usually "abnormal hooks"; their values are lists of functions, but
these functions are called in a special way (they are passed arguments,
or their values are used).  A few of these variables are actually normal
hooks which were named before we established the convention that normal
hooks' names should end in `-hook'.

   The variables whose names end in `-function' have single functions
as their values.  (In older Emacs versions, some of these variables had
names ending in `-hook' even though they were not normal hooks;
however, we have renamed all of those.)
