Subroutines of Visiting
-----------------------

   The `find-file-noselect' function uses two important subroutines
which are sometimes useful in user Lisp code: `create-file-buffer' and
`after-find-file'.  This section explains how to use them.

 - Function: create-file-buffer FILENAME
     This function creates a suitably named buffer for visiting
     FILENAME, and returns it.  It uses FILENAME (sans directory) as
     the name if that name is free; otherwise, it appends a string such
     as `<2>' to get an unused name.  See also *Note Creating Buffers::.

     *Please note:* `create-file-buffer' does *not* associate the new
     buffer with a file and does not select the buffer.  It also does
     not use the default major mode.

          (create-file-buffer "foo")
               => #<buffer foo>
          (create-file-buffer "foo")
               => #<buffer foo<2>>
          (create-file-buffer "foo")
               => #<buffer foo<3>>

     This function is used by `find-file-noselect'.  It uses
     `generate-new-buffer' (*note Creating Buffers::.).

 - Function: after-find-file &optional ERROR WARN
     This function sets the buffer major mode, and parses local
     variables (*note Auto Major Mode::.).  It is called by
     `find-file-noselect' and by the default revert function (*note
     Reverting::.).

     If reading the file got an error because the file does not exist,
     but its directory does exist, the caller should pass a non-`nil'
     value for ERROR.  In that case, `after-find-file' issues a warning:
     `(New File)'.  For more serious errors, the caller should usually
     not call `after-find-file'.

     If WARN is non-`nil', then this function issues a warning if an
     auto-save file exists and is more recent than the visited file.

     The last thing `after-find-file' does is call all the functions in
     the list `find-file-hooks'.

Saving Buffers
==============

   When you edit a file in Emacs, you are actually working on a buffer
that is visiting that file--that is, the contents of the file are
copied into the buffer and the copy is what you edit.  Changes to the
buffer do not change the file until you "save" the buffer, which means
copying the contents of the buffer into the file.

 - Command: save-buffer &optional BACKUP-OPTION
     This function saves the contents of the current buffer in its
     visited file if the buffer has been modified since it was last
     visited or saved.  Otherwise it does nothing.

     `save-buffer' is responsible for making backup files.  Normally,
     BACKUP-OPTION is `nil', and `save-buffer' makes a backup file only
     if this is the first save since visiting the file.  Other values
     for BACKUP-OPTION request the making of backup files in other
     circumstances:

        * With an argument of 4 or 64, reflecting 1 or 3 `C-u''s, the
          `save-buffer' function marks this version of the file to be
          backed up when the buffer is next saved.

        * With an argument of 16 or 64, reflecting 2 or 3 `C-u''s, the
          `save-buffer' function unconditionally backs up the previous
          version of the file before saving it.

 - Command: save-some-buffers &optional SAVE-SILENTLY-P EXITING
     This command saves some modified file-visiting buffers.  Normally
     it asks the user about each buffer.  But if SAVE-SILENTLY-P is
     non-`nil', it saves all the file-visiting buffers without querying
     the user.

     The optional EXITING argument, if non-`nil', requests this
     function to offer also to save certain other buffers that are not
     visiting files.  These are buffers that have a non-`nil'
     buffer-local value of `buffer-offer-save'.  (A user who says yes to
     saving one of these is asked to specify a file name to use.)  The
     `save-buffers-kill-emacs' function passes a non-`nil' value for
     this argument.

 - Command: write-file FILENAME
     This function writes the current buffer into file FILENAME, makes
     the buffer visit that file, and marks it not modified.  Then it
     renames the buffer based on FILENAME, appending a string like `<2>'
     if necessary to make a unique buffer name.  It does most of this
     work by calling `set-visited-file-name' (*note Buffer File
     Name::.) and `save-buffer'.

   Saving a buffer runs several hooks.  It also performs format
conversion (*note Format Conversion::.), and may save text properties in
"annotations" (*note Saving Properties::.).

 - Variable: write-file-hooks
     The value of this variable is a list of functions to be called
     before writing out a buffer to its visited file.  If one of them
     returns non-`nil', the file is considered already written and the
     rest of the functions are not called, nor is the usual code for
     writing the file executed.

     If a function in `write-file-hooks' returns non-`nil', it is
     responsible for making a backup file (if that is appropriate).  To
     do so, execute the following code:

          (or buffer-backed-up (backup-buffer))

     You might wish to save the file modes value returned by
     `backup-buffer' and use that to set the mode bits of the file that
     you write.  This is what `save-buffer' normally does.

     The hook functions in `write-file-hooks' are also responsible for
     encoding the data (if desired): they must choose a suitable coding
     system (*note Lisp and Coding Systems::.), perform the encoding
     (*note Explicit Encoding::.), and set `last-coding-system-used' to
     the coding system that was used (*note Encoding and I/O::.).

     Do not make this variable buffer-local.  To set up buffer-specific
     hook functions, use `write-contents-hooks' instead.

     Even though this is not a normal hook, you can use `add-hook' and
     `remove-hook' to manipulate the list.  *Note Hooks::.

 - Variable: local-write-file-hooks
     This works just like `write-file-hooks', but it is intended to be
     made buffer-local in particular buffers, and used for hooks that
     pertain to the file name or the way the buffer contents were
     obtained.

     The variable is marked as a permanent local, so that changing the
     major mode does not alter a buffer-local value.  This is
     convenient for packages that read "file" contents in special ways,
     and set up hooks to save the data in a corresponding way.

 - Variable: write-contents-hooks
     This works just like `write-file-hooks', but it is intended for
     hooks that pertain to the contents of the file, as opposed to
     hooks that pertain to where the file came from.  Such hooks are
     usually set up by major modes, as buffer-local bindings for this
     variable.

     This variable automatically becomes buffer-local whenever it is
     set; switching to a new major mode always resets this variable.
     When you use `add-hooks' to add an element to this hook, you
     should *not* specify a non-`nil' LOCAL argument, since this
     variable is used *only* buffer-locally.

 - Variable: after-save-hook
     This normal hook runs after a buffer has been saved in its visited
     file.  One use of this hook is in Fast Lock mode; it uses this
     hook to save the highlighting information in a cache file.

 - Variable: file-precious-flag
     If this variable is non-`nil', then `save-buffer' protects against
     I/O errors while saving by writing the new file to a temporary
     name instead of the name it is supposed to have, and then renaming
     it to the intended name after it is clear there are no errors.
     This procedure prevents problems such as a lack of disk space from
     resulting in an invalid file.

     As a side effect, backups are necessarily made by copying.  *Note
     Rename or Copy::.  Yet, at the same time, saving a precious file
     always breaks all hard links between the file you save and other
     file names.

     Some modes give this variable a non-`nil' buffer-local value in
     particular buffers.

 - User Option: require-final-newline
     This variable determines whether files may be written out that do
     *not* end with a newline.  If the value of the variable is `t',
     then `save-buffer' silently adds a newline at the end of the file
     whenever the buffer being saved does not already end in one.  If
     the value of the variable is non-`nil', but not `t', then
     `save-buffer' asks the user whether to add a newline each time the
     case arises.

     If the value of the variable is `nil', then `save-buffer' doesn't
     add newlines at all.  `nil' is the default value, but a few major
     modes set it to `t' in particular buffers.

   See also the function `set-visited-file-name' (*note Buffer File
Name::.).

Reading from Files
==================

   You can copy a file from the disk and insert it into a buffer using
the `insert-file-contents' function.  Don't use the user-level command
`insert-file' in a Lisp program, as that sets the mark.

 - Function: insert-file-contents FILENAME &optional VISIT BEG END
          REPLACE
     This function inserts the contents of file FILENAME into the
     current buffer after point.  It returns a list of the absolute
     file name and the length of the data inserted.  An error is
     signaled if FILENAME is not the name of a file that can be read.

     The function `insert-file-contents' checks the file contents
     against the defined file formats, and converts the file contents if
     appropriate.  *Note Format Conversion::.  It also calls the
     functions in the list `after-insert-file-functions'; see *Note
     Saving Properties::.

     If VISIT is non-`nil', this function additionally marks the buffer
     as unmodified and sets up various fields in the buffer so that it
     is visiting the file FILENAME: these include the buffer's visited
     file name and its last save file modtime.  This feature is used by
     `find-file-noselect' and you probably should not use it yourself.

     If BEG and END are non-`nil', they should be integers specifying
     the portion of the file to insert.  In this case, VISIT must be
     `nil'.  For example,

          (insert-file-contents filename nil 0 500)

     inserts the first 500 characters of a file.

     If the argument REPLACE is non-`nil', it means to replace the
     contents of the buffer (actually, just the accessible portion)
     with the contents of the file.  This is better than simply
     deleting the buffer contents and inserting the whole file, because
     (1) it preserves some marker positions and (2) it puts less data
     in the undo list.

     It is possible to read a special file (such as a FIFO or an I/O
     device) with `insert-file-contents', as long as REPLACE and VISIT
     are `nil'.

 - Function: insert-file-contents-literally FILENAME &optional VISIT
          BEG END REPLACE
     This function works like `insert-file-contents' except that it does
     not do format decoding (*note Format Conversion::.), does not do
     character code conversion (*note Coding Systems::.), does not run
     `find-file-hooks', does not perform automatic uncompression, and so
     on.

   If you want to pass a file name to another process so that another
program can read the file, use the function `file-local-copy'; see
*Note Magic File Names::.


File: elisp,  Node: Writing to Files,  Next: File Locks,  Prev: Reading from Files,  Up: Files

Writing to Files
================

   You can write the contents of a buffer, or part of a buffer, directly
to a file on disk using the `append-to-file' and `write-region'
functions.  Don't use these functions to write to files that are being
visited; that could cause confusion in the mechanisms for visiting.

 - Command: append-to-file START END FILENAME
     This function appends the contents of the region delimited by
     START and END in the current buffer to the end of file FILENAME.
     If that file does not exist, it is created.  This function returns
     `nil'.

     An error is signaled if FILENAME specifies a nonwritable file, or
     a nonexistent file in a directory where files cannot be created.

 - Command: write-region START END FILENAME &optional APPEND VISIT
          CONFIRM
     This function writes the region delimited by START and END in the
     current buffer into the file specified by FILENAME.

     If START is a string, then `write-region' writes or appends that
     string, rather than text from the buffer.

     If APPEND is non-`nil', then the specified text is appended to the
     existing file contents (if any).

     If CONFIRM is non-`nil', then `write-region' asks for confirmation
     if FILENAME names an existing file.

     If VISIT is `t', then Emacs establishes an association between the
     buffer and the file: the buffer is then visiting that file.  It
     also sets the last file modification time for the current buffer to
     FILENAME's modtime, and marks the buffer as not modified.  This
     feature is used by `save-buffer', but you probably should not use
     it yourself.

     If VISIT is a string, it specifies the file name to visit.  This
     way, you can write the data to one file (FILENAME) while recording
     the buffer as visiting another file (VISIT).  The argument VISIT
     is used in the echo area message and also for file locking; VISIT
     is stored in `buffer-file-name'.  This feature is used to
     implement `file-precious-flag'; don't use it yourself unless you
     really know what you're doing.

     The function `write-region' converts the data which it writes to
     the appropriate file formats specified by `buffer-file-format'.
     *Note Format Conversion::.  It also calls the functions in the list
     `write-region-annotate-functions'; see *Note Saving Properties::.

     Normally, `write-region' displays the message `Wrote FILENAME' in
     the echo area.  If VISIT is neither `t' nor `nil' nor a string,
     then this message is inhibited.  This feature is useful for
     programs that use files for internal purposes, files that the user
     does not need to know about.

 - Macro: with-temp-file FILE BODY...
     The `with-temp-file' macro evaluates the BODY forms with a
     temporary buffer as the current buffer; then, at the end, it
     writes the buffer contents into file FILE.  It kills the temporary
     buffer when finished, restoring the buffer that was current before
     the `with-temp-file' form.  Then it returns the value of the last
     form in BODY.

     The current buffer is restored even in case of an abnormal exit via
     `throw' or error (*note Nonlocal Exits::.).

     See also `with-temp-buffer' in *Note Current Buffer::.

File Locks
==========

   When two users edit the same file at the same time, they are likely
to interfere with each other.  Emacs tries to prevent this situation
from arising by recording a "file lock" when a file is being modified.
Emacs can then detect the first attempt to modify a buffer visiting a
file that is locked by another Emacs job, and ask the user what to do.

   File locks are not completely reliable when multiple machines can
share file systems.  When file locks do not work, it is possible for two
users to make changes simultaneously, but Emacs can still warn the user
who saves second.  Also, the detection of modification of a buffer
visiting a file changed on disk catches some cases of simultaneous
editing; see *Note Modification Time::.

 - Function: file-locked-p FILENAME
     This function returns `nil' if the file FILENAME is not locked.
     It returns `t' if it is locked by this Emacs process, and it
     returns the name of the user who has locked it if it is locked by
     some other job.

          (file-locked-p "foo")
               => nil

 - Function: lock-buffer &optional FILENAME
     This function locks the file FILENAME, if the current buffer is
     modified.  The argument FILENAME defaults to the current buffer's
     visited file.  Nothing is done if the current buffer is not
     visiting a file, or is not modified.

 - Function: unlock-buffer
     This function unlocks the file being visited in the current buffer,
     if the buffer is modified.  If the buffer is not modified, then
     the file should not be locked, so this function does nothing.  It
     also does nothing if the current buffer is not visiting a file.

 - Function: ask-user-about-lock FILE OTHER-USER
     This function is called when the user tries to modify FILE, but it
     is locked by another user named OTHER-USER.  The default
     definition of this function asks the user to say what to do.  The
     value this function returns determines what Emacs does next:

        * A value of `t' says to grab the lock on the file.  Then this
          user may edit the file and OTHER-USER loses the lock.

        * A value of `nil' says to ignore the lock and let this user
          edit the file anyway.

        * This function may instead signal a `file-locked' error, in
          which case the change that the user was about to make does
          not take place.

          The error message for this error looks like this:

               error--> File is locked: FILE OTHER-USER

          where `file' is the name of the file and OTHER-USER is the
          name of the user who has locked the file.

     If you wish, you can replace the `ask-user-about-lock' function
     with your own version that makes the decision in another way.  The
     code for its usual definition is in `userlock.el'.

Information about Files
=======================

   The functions described in this section all operate on strings that
designate file names.  All the functions have names that begin with the
word `file'.  These functions all return information about actual files
or directories, so their arguments must all exist as actual files or
directories unless otherwise noted.

* Testing Accessibility::   Is a given file readable?  Writable?
* Kinds of Files::          Is it a directory?  A symbolic link?
* Truenames::		    Eliminating symbolic links from a file name.
* File Attributes::         How large is it?  Any other names?  Etc.


File: elisp,  Node: Testing Accessibility,  Next: Kinds of Files,  Up: Information about Files

Testing Accessibility
---------------------

   These functions test for permission to access a file in specific
ways.

 - Function: file-exists-p FILENAME
     This function returns `t' if a file named FILENAME appears to
     exist.  This does not mean you can necessarily read the file, only
     that you can find out its attributes.  (On Unix, this is true if
     the file exists and you have execute permission on the containing
     directories, regardless of the protection of the file itself.)

     If the file does not exist, or if fascist access control policies
     prevent you from finding the attributes of the file, this function
     returns `nil'.

 - Function: file-readable-p FILENAME
     This function returns `t' if a file named FILENAME exists and you
     can read it.  It returns `nil' otherwise.

          (file-readable-p "files.texi")
               => t
          (file-exists-p "/usr/spool/mqueue")
               => t
          (file-readable-p "/usr/spool/mqueue")
               => nil

 - Function: file-executable-p FILENAME
     This function returns `t' if a file named FILENAME exists and you
     can execute it.  It returns `nil' otherwise.  If the file is a
     directory, execute permission means you can check the existence and
     attributes of files inside the directory, and open those files if
     their modes permit.

 - Function: file-writable-p FILENAME
     This function returns `t' if the file FILENAME can be written or
     created by you, and `nil' otherwise.  A file is writable if the
     file exists and you can write it.  It is creatable if it does not
     exist, but the specified directory does exist and you can write in
     that directory.

     In the third example below, `foo' is not writable because the
     parent directory does not exist, even though the user could create
     such a directory.

          (file-writable-p "~/foo")
               => t
          (file-writable-p "/foo")
               => nil
          (file-writable-p "~/no-such-dir/foo")
               => nil

 - Function: file-accessible-directory-p DIRNAME
     This function returns `t' if you have permission to open existing
     files in the directory whose name as a file is DIRNAME; otherwise
     (or if there is no such directory), it returns `nil'.  The value
     of DIRNAME may be either a directory name or the file name of a
     file which is a directory.

     Example: after the following,

          (file-accessible-directory-p "/foo")
               => nil

     we can deduce that any attempt to read a file in `/foo/' will give
     an error.

 - Function: access-file FILENAME STRING
     This function opens file FILENAME for reading, then closes it and
     returns `nil'.  However, if the open fails, it signals an error
     using STRING as the error message text.

 - Function: file-ownership-preserved-p FILENAME
     This function returns `t' if deleting the file FILENAME and then
     creating it anew would keep the file's owner unchanged.

 - Function: file-newer-than-file-p FILENAME1 FILENAME2
     This function returns `t' if the file FILENAME1 is newer than file
     FILENAME2.  If FILENAME1 does not exist, it returns `nil'.  If
     FILENAME2 does not exist, it returns `t'.

     In the following example, assume that the file `aug-19' was written
     on the 19th, `aug-20' was written on the 20th, and the file
     `no-file' doesn't exist at all.

          (file-newer-than-file-p "aug-19" "aug-20")
               => nil
          (file-newer-than-file-p "aug-20" "aug-19")
               => t
          (file-newer-than-file-p "aug-19" "no-file")
               => t
          (file-newer-than-file-p "no-file" "aug-19")
               => nil

     You can use `file-attributes' to get a file's last modification
     time as a list of two numbers.  *Note File Attributes::.

Distinguishing Kinds of Files
-----------------------------

   This section describes how to distinguish various kinds of files,
such as directories, symbolic links, and ordinary files.

 - Function: file-symlink-p FILENAME
     If the file FILENAME is a symbolic link, the `file-symlink-p'
     function returns the file name to which it is linked.  This may be
     the name of a text file, a directory, or even another symbolic
     link, or it may be a nonexistent file name.

     If the file FILENAME is not a symbolic link (or there is no such
     file), `file-symlink-p' returns `nil'.

          (file-symlink-p "foo")
               => nil
          (file-symlink-p "sym-link")
               => "foo"

               => "sym-link"
          (file-symlink-p "/bin")
               => "/pub/bin"


 - Function: file-directory-p FILENAME
     This function returns `t' if FILENAME is the name of an existing
     directory, `nil' otherwise.

          (file-directory-p "~rms")
               => t
          (file-directory-p "~rms/lewis/files.texi")

               => nil
          (file-directory-p
           (substitute-in-file-name "$HOME"))
               => t

 - Function: file-regular-p FILENAME
     This function returns `t' if the file FILENAME exists and is a
     regular file (not a directory, symbolic link, named pipe,
     terminal, or other I/O device).

Truenames
---------

   The "truename" of a file is the name that you get by following
symbolic links until none remain, then simplifying away `.' and `..'
appearing as components.  Strictly speaking, a file need not have a
unique truename; the number of distinct truenames a file has is equal
to the number of hard links to the file.  However, truenames are useful
because they eliminate symbolic links as a cause of name variation.

 - Function: file-truename FILENAME
     The function `file-truename' returns the true name of the file
     FILENAME.  This is the name that you get by following symbolic
     links until none remain.  The argument must be an absolute file
     name.

   *Note Buffer File Name::, for related information.

Other Information about Files
-----------------------------

   This section describes the functions for getting detailed information
about a file, other than its contents.  This information includes the
mode bits that control access permission, the owner and group numbers,
the number of names, the inode number, the size, and the times of access
and modification.

 - Function: file-modes FILENAME
     This function returns the mode bits of FILENAME, as an integer.
     The mode bits are also called the file permissions, and they
     specify access control in the usual Unix fashion.  If the
     low-order bit is 1, then the file is executable by all users, if
     the second-lowest-order bit is 1, then the file is writable by all
     users, etc.

     The highest value returnable is 4095 (7777 octal), meaning that
     everyone has read, write, and execute permission, that the SUID bit
     is set for both others and group, and that the sticky bit is set.

          (file-modes "~/junk/diffs")
               => 492               ; Decimal integer.
          (format "%o" 492)
               => "754"             ; Convert to octal.
          
          (set-file-modes "~/junk/diffs" 438)
               => nil
          
          (format "%o" 438)
               => "666"             ; Convert to octal.
          
          % ls -l diffs
            -rw-rw-rw-  1 lewis 0 3063 Oct 30 16:00 diffs

 - Function: file-nlinks FILENAME
     This functions returns the number of names (i.e., hard links) that
     file FILENAME has.  If the file does not exist, then this function
     returns `nil'.  Note that symbolic links have no effect on this
     function, because they are not considered to be names of the files
     they link to.

          % ls -l foo*
          -rw-rw-rw-  2 rms       4 Aug 19 01:27 foo
          -rw-rw-rw-  2 rms       4 Aug 19 01:27 foo1
          
          (file-nlinks "foo")
               => 2
          (file-nlinks "doesnt-exist")
               => nil

 - Function: file-attributes FILENAME
     This function returns a list of attributes of file FILENAME.  If
     the specified file cannot be opened, it returns `nil'.

     The elements of the list, in order, are:

       0. `t' for a directory, a string for a symbolic link (the name
          linked to), or `nil' for a text file.

       1. The number of names the file has.  Alternate names, also
          known as hard links, can be created by using the
          `add-name-to-file' function (*note Changing Files::.).

       2. The file's UID.

       3. The file's GID.

       4. The time of last access, as a list of two integers.  The
          first integer has the high-order 16 bits of time, the second
          has the low 16 bits.  (This is similar to the value of
          `current-time'; see *Note Time of Day::.)

       5. The time of last modification as a list of two integers (as
          above).

       6. The time of last status change as a list of two integers (as
          above).

       7. The size of the file in bytes.

       8. The file's modes, as a string of ten letters or dashes, as in
          `ls -l'.

       9. `t' if the file's GID would change if file were deleted and
          recreated; `nil' otherwise.

      10. The file's inode number.  If possible, this is an integer.
          If the inode number is too large to be represented as an
          integer in Emacs Lisp, then the value has the form `(HIGH .
          LOW)', where LOW holds the low 16 bits.

      11. The file system number of the file system that the file is
          in.  This element and the file's inode number together give
          enough information to distinguish any two files on the
          system--no two files can have the same values for both of
          these numbers.

     For example, here are the file attributes for `files.texi':

          (file-attributes "files.texi")
               =>  (nil 1 2235 75
                    (8489 20284)
                    (8489 20284)
                    (8489 20285)
                    14906 "-rw-rw-rw-"
                    nil 129500 -32252)

     and here is how the result is interpreted:

    `nil'
          is neither a directory nor a symbolic link.

    `1'
          has only one name (the name `files.texi' in the current
          default directory).

    `2235'
          is owned by the user with UID 2235.

    `75'
          is in the group with GID 75.

    `(8489 20284)'
          was last accessed on Aug 19 00:09.

    `(8489 20284)'
          was last modified on Aug 19 00:09.

    `(8489 20285)'
          last had its inode changed on Aug 19 00:09.

    `14906'
          is 14906 characters long.

    `"-rw-rw-rw-"'
          has a mode of read and write access for the owner, group, and
          world.

    `nil'
          would retain the same GID if it were recreated.

    `129500'
          has an inode number of 129500.

    `-32252'
          is on file system number -32252.

Changing File Names and Attributes
==================================

   The functions in this section rename, copy, delete, link, and set the
modes of files.

   In the functions that have an argument NEWNAME, if a file by the
name of NEWNAME already exists, the actions taken depend on the value
of the argument OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS:

   * Signal a `file-already-exists' error if OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is
     `nil'.

   * Request confirmation if OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is a number.

   * Replace the old file without confirmation if OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS
     is any other value.

 - Function: add-name-to-file OLDNAME NEWNAME &optional
          OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS
     This function gives the file named OLDNAME the additional name
     NEWNAME.  This means that NEWNAME becomes a new "hard link" to
     OLDNAME.

     In the first part of the following example, we list two files,
     `foo' and `foo3'.

          % ls -li fo*
          81908 -rw-rw-rw-  1 rms       29 Aug 18 20:32 foo
          84302 -rw-rw-rw-  1 rms       24 Aug 18 20:31 foo3

     Now we create a hard link, by calling `add-name-to-file', then list
     the files again.  This shows two names for one file, `foo' and
     `foo2'.

          (add-name-to-file "foo" "foo2")
               => nil
          
          % ls -li fo*
          81908 -rw-rw-rw-  2 rms       29 Aug 18 20:32 foo
          81908 -rw-rw-rw-  2 rms       29 Aug 18 20:32 foo2
          84302 -rw-rw-rw-  1 rms       24 Aug 18 20:31 foo3

     Finally, we evaluate the following:

          (add-name-to-file "foo" "foo3" t)

     and list the files again.  Now there are three names for one file:
     `foo', `foo2', and `foo3'.  The old contents of `foo3' are lost.

          (add-name-to-file "foo1" "foo3")
               => nil
          
          % ls -li fo*
          81908 -rw-rw-rw-  3 rms       29 Aug 18 20:32 foo
          81908 -rw-rw-rw-  3 rms       29 Aug 18 20:32 foo2
          81908 -rw-rw-rw-  3 rms       29 Aug 18 20:32 foo3

     This function is meaningless on operating systems where multiple
     names for one file are not allowed.

     See also `file-nlinks' in *Note File Attributes::.

 - Command: rename-file FILENAME NEWNAME &optional OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS
     This command renames the file FILENAME as NEWNAME.

     If FILENAME has additional names aside from FILENAME, it continues
     to have those names.  In fact, adding the name NEWNAME with
     `add-name-to-file' and then deleting FILENAME has the same effect
     as renaming, aside from momentary intermediate states.

     In an interactive call, this function prompts for FILENAME and
     NEWNAME in the minibuffer; also, it requests confirmation if
     NEWNAME already exists.

 - Command: copy-file OLDNAME NEWNAME &optional OK-IF-EXISTS TIME
     This command copies the file OLDNAME to NEWNAME.  An error is
     signaled if OLDNAME does not exist.

     If TIME is non-`nil', then this function gives the new file the
     same last-modified time that the old one has.  (This works on only
     some operating systems.)  If setting the time gets an error,
     `copy-file' signals a `file-date-error' error.

     In an interactive call, this function prompts for FILENAME and
     NEWNAME in the minibuffer; also, it requests confirmation if
     NEWNAME already exists.

 - Command: delete-file FILENAME
     This command deletes the file FILENAME, like the shell command `rm
     FILENAME'.  If the file has multiple names, it continues to exist
     under the other names.

     A suitable kind of `file-error' error is signaled if the file does
     not exist, or is not deletable.  (On Unix, a file is deletable if
     its directory is writable.)

     See also `delete-directory' in *Note Create/Delete Dirs::.

 - Command: make-symbolic-link FILENAME NEWNAME &optional OK-IF-EXISTS
     This command makes a symbolic link to FILENAME, named NEWNAME.
     This is like the shell command `ln -s FILENAME NEWNAME'.

     In an interactive call, this function prompts for FILENAME and
     NEWNAME in the minibuffer; also, it requests confirmation if
     NEWNAME already exists.

 - Function: define-logical-name VARNAME STRING
     This function defines the logical name NAME to have the value
     STRING.  It is available only on VMS.

 - Function: set-file-modes FILENAME MODE
     This function sets mode bits of FILENAME to MODE (which must be an
     integer).  Only the low 12 bits of MODE are used.

 - Function: set-default-file-modes MODE
     This function sets the default file protection for new files
     created by Emacs and its subprocesses.  Every file created with
     Emacs initially has this protection.  On Unix, the default
     protection is the bitwise complement of the "umask" value.

     The argument MODE must be an integer.  On most systems, only the
     low 9 bits of MODE are meaningful.

     Saving a modified version of an existing file does not count as
     creating the file; it does not change the file's mode, and does
     not use the default file protection.

 - Function: default-file-modes
     This function returns the current default protection value.

   On MS-DOS, there is no such thing as an "executable" file mode bit.
So Emacs considers a file executable if its name ends in `.com', `.bat'
or `.exe'.  This is reflected in the values returned by `file-modes'
and `file-attributes'.

File Names
==========

   Files are generally referred to by their names, in Emacs as
elsewhere.  File names in Emacs are represented as strings.  The
functions that operate on a file all expect a file name argument.

   In addition to operating on files themselves, Emacs Lisp programs
often need to operate on file names; i.e., to take them apart and to use
part of a name to construct related file names.  This section describes
how to manipulate file names.

   The functions in this section do not actually access files, so they
can operate on file names that do not refer to an existing file or
directory.

   On VMS, all these functions understand both VMS file-name syntax and
Unix syntax.  This is so that all the standard Lisp libraries can
specify file names in Unix syntax and work properly on VMS without
change.  On MS-DOS and MS-Windows, these functions understand MS-DOS or
MS-Windows file-name syntax as well as Unix syntax.

* Directory Names::       A directory's name as a directory

File: elisp,  Node: File Name Components,  Next: Directory Names,  Up: File Names

File Name Components
--------------------

   The operating system groups files into directories.  To specify a
file, you must specify the directory and the file's name within that
directory.  Therefore, Emacs considers a file name as having two main
parts: the "directory name" part, and the "nondirectory" part (or "file
name within the directory").  Either part may be empty.  Concatenating
these two parts reproduces the original file name.

   On Unix, the directory part is everything up to and including the
last slash; the nondirectory part is the rest.  The rules in VMS syntax
are complicated.

   For some purposes, the nondirectory part is further subdivided into
the name proper and the "version number".  On Unix, only backup files
have version numbers in their names.  On VMS, every file has a version
number, but most of the time the file name actually used in Emacs omits
the version number, so that version numbers in Emacs are found mostly
in directory lists.

 - Function: file-name-directory FILENAME
     This function returns the directory part of FILENAME (or `nil' if
     FILENAME does not include a directory part).  On Unix, the
     function returns a string ending in a slash.  On VMS, it returns a
     string ending in one of the three characters `:', `]', or `>'.

          (file-name-directory "lewis/foo")  ; Unix example
               => "lewis/"
          (file-name-directory "foo")        ; Unix example
               => nil
          (file-name-directory "[X]FOO.TMP") ; VMS example
               => "[X]"

 - Function: file-name-nondirectory FILENAME
     This function returns the nondirectory part of FILENAME.

          (file-name-nondirectory "lewis/foo")
               => "foo"
          (file-name-nondirectory "foo")
               => "foo"
          ;; The following example is accurate only on VMS.
          (file-name-nondirectory "[X]FOO.TMP")
               => "FOO.TMP"

 - Function: file-name-sans-versions FILENAME
     This function returns FILENAME with any file version numbers,
     backup version numbers, or trailing tildes deleted.

          (file-name-sans-versions "~rms/foo.~1~")
               => "~rms/foo"
          (file-name-sans-versions "~rms/foo~")
               => "~rms/foo"
          (file-name-sans-versions "~rms/foo")
               => "~rms/foo"
          ;; The following example applies to VMS only.
          (file-name-sans-versions "foo;23")
               => "foo"

 - Function: file-name-sans-extension FILENAME
     This function returns FILENAME minus its "extension," if any.  The
     extension, in a file name, is the part that starts with the last
     `.' in the last name component.  For example,

          (file-name-sans-extension "foo.lose.c")
               => "foo.lose"
          (file-name-sans-extension "big.hack/foo")
               => "big.hack/foo"


File: elisp,  Node: Directory Names,  Next: Relative File Names,  Prev: File Name Components,  Up: File Names

Directory Names
---------------

   A "directory name" is the name of a directory.  A directory is a
kind of file, and it has a file name, which is related to the directory
name but not identical to it.  (This is not quite the same as the usual
Unix terminology.)  These two different names for the same entity are
related by a syntactic transformation.  On Unix, this is simple: a
directory name ends in a slash, whereas the directory's name as a file
lacks that slash.  On VMS, the relationship is more complicated.

   The difference between a directory name and its name as a file is
subtle but crucial.  When an Emacs variable or function argument is
described as being a directory name, a file name of a directory is not
acceptable.

   The following two functions convert between directory names and file
names.  They do nothing special with environment variable substitutions
such as `$HOME', and the constructs `~', and `..'.

 - Function: file-name-as-directory FILENAME
     This function returns a string representing FILENAME in a form
     that the operating system will interpret as the name of a
     directory.  In Unix, this means appending a slash to the string
     (if it does not already end in one).  On VMS, the function
     converts a string of the form `[X]Y.DIR.1' to the form `[X.Y]'.

          (file-name-as-directory "~rms/lewis")
               => "~rms/lewis/"

 - Function: directory-file-name DIRNAME
     This function returns a string representing DIRNAME in a form that
     the operating system will interpret as the name of a file.  On
     Unix, this means removing the final slash from the string.  On
     VMS, the function converts a string of the form `[X.Y]' to
     `[X]Y.DIR.1'.

          (directory-file-name "~lewis/")
               => "~lewis"

   Directory name abbreviations are useful for directories that are
normally accessed through symbolic links.  Sometimes the users recognize
primarily the link's name as "the name" of the directory, and find it
annoying to see the directory's "real" name.  If you define the link
name as an abbreviation for the "real" name, Emacs shows users the
abbreviation instead.

 - Variable: directory-abbrev-alist
     The variable `directory-abbrev-alist' contains an alist of
     abbreviations to use for file directories.  Each element has the
     form `(FROM . TO)', and says to replace FROM with TO when it
     appears in a directory name.  The FROM string is actually a
     regular expression; it should always start with `^'.  The function
     `abbreviate-file-name' performs these substitutions.

     You can set this variable in `site-init.el' to describe the
     abbreviations appropriate for your site.

     Here's an example, from a system on which file system `/home/fsf'
     and so on are normally accessed through symbolic links named `/fsf'
     and so on.

          (("^/home/fsf" . "/fsf")
           ("^/home/gp" . "/gp")
           ("^/home/gd" . "/gd"))

   To convert a directory name to its abbreviation, use this function:

 - Function: abbreviate-file-name DIRNAME
     This function applies abbreviations from `directory-abbrev-alist'
     to its argument, and substitutes `~' for the user's home directory.

Absolute and Relative File Names
--------------------------------

   All the directories in the file system form a tree starting at the
root directory.  A file name can specify all the directory names
starting from the root of the tree; then it is called an "absolute"
file name.  Or it can specify the position of the file in the tree
relative to a default directory; then it is called a "relative" file
name.  On Unix, an absolute file name starts with a slash or a tilde
(`~'), and a relative one does not.  The rules on VMS are complicated.

 - Function: file-name-absolute-p FILENAME
     This function returns `t' if file FILENAME is an absolute file
     name, `nil' otherwise.  On VMS, this function understands both
     Unix syntax and VMS syntax.

          (file-name-absolute-p "~rms/foo")
               => t
          (file-name-absolute-p "rms/foo")
               => nil
          (file-name-absolute-p "/user/rms/foo")
               => t


File: elisp,  Node: File Name Expansion,  Next: Unique File Names,  Prev: Relative File Names,  Up: File Names

Functions that Expand Filenames
-------------------------------

   "Expansion" of a file name means converting a relative file name to
an absolute one.  Since this is done relative to a default directory,
you must specify the default directory name as well as the file name to
be expanded.  Expansion also simplifies file names by eliminating
redundancies such as `./' and `NAME/../'.

 - Function: expand-file-name FILENAME &optional DIRECTORY
     This function converts FILENAME to an absolute file name.  If
     DIRECTORY is supplied, it is the default directory to start with
     if FILENAME is relative.  (The value of DIRECTORY should itself be
     an absolute directory name; it may start with `~'.)  Otherwise,
     the current buffer's value of `default-directory' is used.  For
     example:

          (expand-file-name "foo")
               => "/xcssun/users/rms/lewis/foo"
          (expand-file-name "../foo")
               => "/xcssun/users/rms/foo"
          (expand-file-name "foo" "/usr/spool/")
               => "/usr/spool/foo"
          (expand-file-name "$HOME/foo")
               => "/xcssun/users/rms/lewis/$HOME/foo"

     Filenames containing `.' or `..' are simplified to their canonical
     form:

          (expand-file-name "bar/../foo")
               => "/xcssun/users/rms/lewis/foo"

     Note that `expand-file-name' does *not* expand environment
     variables; only `substitute-in-file-name' does that.

 - Function: file-relative-name FILENAME DIRECTORY
     This function does the inverse of expansion--it tries to return a
     relative name that is equivalent to FILENAME when interpreted
     relative to DIRECTORY.

     On some operating systems, an absolute file name begins with a
     device name.  On such systems, FILENAME has no relative equivalent
     based on DIRECTORY if they start with two different device names.
     In this case, `file-relative-name' returns FILENAME in absolute
     form.

          (file-relative-name "/foo/bar" "/foo/")
               => "bar"
          (file-relative-name "/foo/bar" "/hack/")
               => "/foo/bar"

 - Variable: default-directory
     The value of this buffer-local variable is the default directory
     for the current buffer.  It should be an absolute directory name;
     it may start with `~'.  This variable is buffer-local in every
     buffer.

     `expand-file-name' uses the default directory when its second
     argument is `nil'.

     On Unix systems, the value is always a string ending with a slash.

          default-directory
               => "/user/lewis/manual/"

 - Function: substitute-in-file-name FILENAME
     This function replaces environment variables references in
     FILENAME with the environment variable values.  Following standard
     Unix shell syntax, `$' is the prefix to substitute an environment
     variable value.

     The environment variable name is the series of alphanumeric
     characters (including underscores) that follow the `$'.  If the
     character following the `$' is a `{', then the variable name is
     everything up to the matching `}'.

     Here we assume that the environment variable `HOME', which holds
     the user's home directory name, has value `/xcssun/users/rms'.

          (substitute-in-file-name "$HOME/foo")
               => "/xcssun/users/rms/foo"

     After substitution, if a `~' or a `/' appears following a `/',
     everything before the following `/' is discarded:

          (substitute-in-file-name "bar/~/foo")
               => "~/foo"
          (substitute-in-file-name "/usr/local/$HOME/foo")
               => "/xcssun/users/rms/foo"
               ;; `/usr/local/' has been discarded.

     On VMS, `$' substitution is not done, so this function does nothing
     on VMS except discard superfluous initial components as shown
     above.
