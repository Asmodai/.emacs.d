@appendix Standard Hooks

The following is a list of hook variables that let you provide
functions to be called from within Emacs on suitable occasions. 

Most of these variables have names ending with @samp{-hook}.  They are
@dfn{normal hooks}, run by means of @code{run-hooks}.  The value of such
a hook is a list of functions; the functions are called with no
arguments and their values are completely ignored.  The recommended way
to put a new function on such a hook is to call @code{add-hook}.
@xref{Hooks}, for more information about using hooks.

The variables whose names end in @samp{-hooks} or @samp{-functions} are
usually @dfn{abnormal hooks}; their values are lists of functions, but
these functions are called in a special way (they are passed arguments,
or their values are used).  A few of these variables are actually normal
hooks which were named before we established the convention that normal
hooks' names should end in @samp{-hook}.

The variables whose names end in @samp{-function} have single functions
as their values.  (In older Emacs versions, some of these variables had
names ending in @samp{-hook} even though they were not normal hooks;
however, we have renamed all of those.)

@c !!! need  xref  to where each hook is documented or else document it
@c by specifying what is expected, and when it is called relative to
@c mode initialization.
