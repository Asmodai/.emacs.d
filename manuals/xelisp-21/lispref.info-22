Specifying the Toolbar
======================

   In order to specify the contents of a toolbar, set one of the
specifier variables `default-toolbar', `top-toolbar', `bottom-toolbar',
`left-toolbar', or `right-toolbar'.  These are specifiers, which means
you set them with `set-specifier' and query them with `specifier-specs'
or `specifier-instance'.  You will get an error if you try to set them
using `setq'.  The valid instantiators for these specifiers are toolbar
descriptors, as described above.  *Note Specifiers::, for more
information.

   Most of the time, you will set `default-toolbar', which allows the
user to choose where the toolbar should go.

 - Specifier: default-toolbar
     The position of this toolbar is specified in the function
     `default-toolbar-position'.  If the corresponding
     position-specific toolbar (e.g. `top-toolbar' if
     `default-toolbar-position' is `top') does not specify a toolbar in
     a particular domain, then the value of `default-toolbar' in that
     domain, of any, will be used instead.

   Note that the toolbar at any particular position will not be
displayed unless its thickness (width or height, depending on
orientation) is non-zero and its visibility status is true.  The
thickness is controlled by the specifiers `top-toolbar-height',
`bottom-toolbar-height', `left-toolbar-width', and
`right-toolbar-width', and the visibility status is controlled by the
specifiers `top-toolbar-visible-p', `bottom-toolbar-visible-p',
`left-toolbar-visible-p', and `right-toolbar-visible-p' (*note Other
Toolbar Variables::).

 - Function: set-default-toolbar-position position
     This function sets the position that the `default-toolbar' will be
     displayed at.  Valid positions are the symbols `top', `bottom',
     `left' and `right'.  What this actually does is set the fallback
     specifier for the position-specific specifier corresponding to the
     given position to `default-toolbar', and set the fallbacks for the
     other position-specific specifiers to `nil'.  It also does the
     same thing for the position-specific thickness and visibility
     specifiers, which inherit from one of `default-toolbar-height' or
     `default-toolbar-width', and from `default-toolbar-visible-p',
     respectively (*note Other Toolbar Variables::).

 - Function: default-toolbar-position
     This function returns the position that the `default-toolbar' will
     be displayed at.

   You can also explicitly set a toolbar at a particular position.  When
redisplay determines what to display at a particular position in a
particular domain (i.e. window), it first consults the position-specific
toolbar.  If that does not yield a toolbar descriptor, the
`default-toolbar' is consulted if `default-toolbar-position' indicates
this position.

 - Specifier: top-toolbar
     Specifier for the toolbar at the top of the frame.

 - Specifier: bottom-toolbar
     Specifier for the toolbar at the bottom of the frame.

 - Specifier: left-toolbar
     Specifier for the toolbar at the left edge of the frame.

 - Specifier: right-toolbar
     Specifier for the toolbar at the right edge of the frame.

 - Function: toolbar-specifier-p object
     This function returns non-`nil' if OBJECT is a toolbar specifier.
     Toolbar specifiers are the actual objects contained in the toolbar
     variables described above, and their valid instantiators are
     toolbar descriptors (*note Toolbar Descriptor Format::).


File: lispref.info,  Node: Other Toolbar Variables,  Prev: Specifying the Toolbar,  Up: Toolbar

Other Toolbar Variables
=======================

   The variables to control the toolbar thickness, visibility status,
and captioned status are all specifiers.  *Note Specifiers::.

 - Specifier: default-toolbar-height
     This specifies the height of the default toolbar, if it's oriented
     horizontally.  The position of the default toolbar is specified by
     the function `set-default-toolbar-position'.  If the corresponding
     position-specific toolbar thickness specifier (e.g.
     `top-toolbar-height' if `default-toolbar-position' is `top') does
     not specify a thickness in a particular domain (a window or a
     frame), then the value of `default-toolbar-height' or
     `default-toolbar-width' (depending on the toolbar orientation) in
     that domain, if any, will be used instead.

 - Specifier: default-toolbar-width
     This specifies the width of the default toolbar, if it's oriented
     vertically.  This behaves like `default-toolbar-height'.

   Note that `default-toolbar-height' is only used when
`default-toolbar-position' is `top' or `bottom', and
`default-toolbar-width' is only used when `default-toolbar-position' is
`left' or `right'.

 - Specifier: top-toolbar-height
     This specifies the height of the top toolbar.

 - Specifier: bottom-toolbar-height
     This specifies the height of the bottom toolbar.

 - Specifier: left-toolbar-width
     This specifies the width of the left toolbar.

 - Specifier: right-toolbar-width
     This specifies the width of the right toolbar.

   Note that all of the position-specific toolbar thickness specifiers
have a fallback value of zero when they do not correspond to the
default toolbar.  Therefore, you will have to set a non-zero thickness
value if you want a position-specific toolbar to be displayed.

 - Specifier: default-toolbar-visible-p
     This specifies whether the default toolbar is visible.  The
     position of the default toolbar is specified by the function
     `set-default-toolbar-position'.  If the corresponding
     position-specific toolbar visibility specifier (e.g.
     `top-toolbar-visible-p' if `default-toolbar-position' is `top')
     does not specify a visible-p value in a particular domain (a
     window or a frame), then the value of `default-toolbar-visible-p'
     in that domain, if any, will be used instead.

 - Specifier: top-toolbar-visible-p
     This specifies whether the top toolbar is visible.

 - Specifier: bottom-toolbar-visible-p
     This specifies whether the bottom toolbar is visible.

 - Specifier: left-toolbar-visible-p
     This specifies whether the left toolbar is visible.

 - Specifier: right-toolbar-visible-p
     This specifies whether the right toolbar is visible.

   `default-toolbar-visible-p' and all of the position-specific toolbar
visibility specifiers have a fallback value of true.

   Internally, toolbar thickness and visibility specifiers are
instantiated in both window and frame domains, for different purposes.
The value in the domain of a frame's selected window specifies the
actual toolbar thickness or visibility that you will see in that frame.
The value in the domain of a frame itself specifies the toolbar
thickness or visibility that is used in frame geometry calculations.

   Thus, for example, if you set the frame width to 80 characters and
the left toolbar width for that frame to 68 pixels, then the frame will
be sized to fit 80 characters plus a 68-pixel left toolbar.  If you then
set the left toolbar width to 0 for a particular buffer (or if that
buffer does not specify a left toolbar or has a `nil' value specified
for `left-toolbar-visible-p'), you will find that, when that buffer is
displayed in the selected window, the window will have a width of 86 or
87 characters--the frame is sized for a 68-pixel left toolbar but the
selected window specifies that the left toolbar is not visible, so it is
expanded to take up the slack.

 - Specifier: toolbar-buttons-captioned-p
     Whether toolbar buttons are captioned.  This affects which glyphs
     from a toolbar button descriptor are chosen.  *Note Toolbar
     Descriptor Format::.

   You can also reset the toolbar to what it was when XEmacs started up.

 - Constant: initial-toolbar-spec
     The toolbar descriptor used to initialize `default-toolbar' at
     startup.

Gutter Intro
============

   A "gutter" is a rectangle displayed along one edge of a frame.  It
can contain arbitrary text or graphics.  It could be considered a
generalization of a toolbar, although toolbars are not currently
implemented using gutters.

   In XEmacs, a gutter can be displayed along any of the four edges of
the frame, and two or more different edges can be displaying gutters
simultaneously.  The contents, thickness, and visibility of the gutters
can be controlled separately, and the values can be per-buffer,
per-frame, etc., using specifiers (*note Specifiers::).

   Normally, there is one gutter displayed in a frame.  Usually, this is
the default gutter, containing buffer tabs, but modes cab override this
and substitute their own gutter.  This default gutter is usually
positioned along the top of the frame, but this can be changed using
`set-default-gutter-position'.

   Note that, for each of the gutter properties (contents, thickness,
and visibility), there is a separate specifier for each of the four
gutter positions (top, bottom, left, and right), and an additional
specifier for the "default" gutter, i.e. the gutter whose position is
controlled by `set-default-gutter-position'.  The way this works is
that `set-default-gutter-position' arranges things so that the
appropriate position-specific specifiers for the default position
inherit from the corresponding default specifiers.  That way, if the
position-specific specifier does not give a value (which it usually
doesn't), then the value from the default specifier applies.  If you
want to control the default gutter, you just change the default
specifiers, and everything works.  A package such as VM that wants to
put its own gutter in a different location from the default just sets
the position-specific specifiers, and if the user sets the default
gutter to the same position, it will just not be visible.

Creating Gutter
===============

 - Function: make-gutter-specifier spec-list
     Return a new `gutter' specifier object with the given specification
     list.  SPEC-LIST can be a list of specifications (each of which is
     a cons of a locale and a list of instantiators), a single
     instantiator, or a list of instantiators.  *Note Specifiers::, for
     more information about specifiers.

     Gutter specifiers are used to specify the format of a gutter.  The
     values of the variables `default-gutter', `top-gutter',
     `left-gutter', `right-gutter', and `bottom-gutter' are always
     gutter specifiers.

     Valid gutter instantiators are called "gutter descriptors" and are
     either strings or property-lists of strings.  See `default-gutter'
     for a description of the exact format.

 - Function: make-gutter-size-specifier spec-list
     Return a new `gutter-size' specifier object with the given spec
     list.  SPEC-LIST can be a list of specifications (each of which is
     a cons of a locale and a list of instantiators), a single
     instantiator, or a list of instantiators.  *Note Specifiers::, for
     more information about specifiers.

     Gutter-size specifiers are used to specify the size of a gutter.
     The values of the variables `default-gutter-size',
     `top-gutter-size', `left-gutter-size', `right-gutter-size', and
     `bottom-gutter-size' are always gutter-size specifiers.

     Valid gutter-size instantiators are either integers or the special
     symbol `autodetect'. If a gutter-size is set to `autodetect' them
     the size of the gutter will be adjusted to just accommodate the
     gutters contents. `autodetect' only works for top and bottom
     gutters.

 - Function: make-gutter-visible-specifier spec-list
     Return a new `gutter-visible' specifier object with the given spec
     list.  SPEC-LIST can be a list of specifications (each of which is
     a cons of a locale and a list of instantiators), a single
     instantiator, or a list of instantiators.  *Note Specifiers::, for
     more information about specifiers.

     Gutter-visible specifiers are used to specify the visibility of a
     gutter.  The values of the variables `default-gutter-visible-p',
     `top-gutter-visible-p', `left-gutter-visible-p',
     `right-gutter-visible-p', and `bottom-gutter-visible-p' are always
     gutter-visible specifiers.

     Valid gutter-visible instantiators are `t', `nil' or a list of
     symbols.  If a gutter-visible instantiator is set to a list of
     symbols, and the corresponding gutter specification is a
     property-list strings, then elements of the gutter specification
     will only be visible if the corresponding symbol occurs in the
     gutter-visible instantiator.


File: lispref.info,  Node: Gutter Descriptor Format,  Next: Specifying a Gutter,  Prev: Creating Gutter,  Up: Gutter

Gutter Descriptor Format
========================

   The contents of a gutter are specified using a "gutter descriptor".
The format of a gutter descriptor is a list of "gutter button
descriptors".  Each gutter button descriptor is a vector in one of the
following formats:

   * `[GLYPH-LIST FUNCTION ENABLED-P HELP]'

   * `[:style 2D-OR-3D]'

   * `[:style 2D-OR-3D :size WIDTH-OR-HEIGHT]'

   * `[:size WIDTH-OR-HEIGHT :style 2D-OR-3D]'

   Optionally, one of the gutter button descriptors may be `nil'
instead of a vector; this signifies the division between the gutter
buttons that are to be displayed flush-left, and the buttons to be
displayed flush-right.

   The first vector format above specifies a normal gutter button; the
others specify blank areas in the gutter.

   For the first vector format:

   * GLYPH-LIST should be a list of one to six glyphs (as created by
     `make-glyph') or a symbol whose value is such a list.  The first
     glyph, which must be provided, is the glyph used to display the
     gutter button when it is in the "up" (not pressed) state.  The
     optional second glyph is for displaying the button when it is in
     the "down" (pressed) state.  The optional third glyph is for when
     the button is disabled.  The last three glyphs are for displaying
     the button in the "up", "down", and "disabled" states,
     respectively, but are used when the user has called for captioned
     gutter buttons (using `gutter-buttons-captioned-p').  The function
     `gutter-make-button-list' is useful in creating these glyph lists.

   * Even if you do not provide separate down-state and disabled-state
     glyphs, the user will still get visual feedback to indicate which
     state the button is in.  Buttons in the up-state are displayed
     with a shadowed border that gives a raised appearance to the
     button.  Buttons in the down-state are displayed with shadows that
     give a recessed appearance.  Buttons in the disabled state are
     displayed with no shadows, giving a 2-d effect.

   * If some of the gutter glyphs are not provided, they inherit as
     follows:

               UP:                up
               DOWN:              down -> up
               DISABLED:          disabled -> up
               CAP-UP:            cap-up -> up
               CAP-DOWN:          cap-down -> cap-up -> down -> up
               CAP-DISABLED:      cap-disabled -> cap-up -> disabled -> up

   * The second element FUNCTION is a function to be called when the
     gutter button is activated (i.e. when the mouse is released over
     the gutter button, if the press occurred in the gutter).  It can
     be any form accepted by `call-interactively', since this is how it
     is invoked.

   * The third element ENABLED-P specifies whether the gutter button is
     enabled (disabled buttons do nothing when they are activated, and
     are displayed differently; see above).  It should be either a
     boolean or a form that evaluates to a boolean.

   * The fourth element HELP, if non-`nil', should be a string.  This
     string is displayed in the echo area when the mouse passes over the
     gutter button.

   For the other vector formats (specifying blank areas of the gutter):

   * 2D-OR-3D should be one of the symbols `2d' or `3d', indicating
     whether the area is displayed with shadows (giving it a raised,
     3-d appearance) or without shadows (giving it a flat appearance).

   * WIDTH-OR-HEIGHT specifies the length, in pixels, of the blank
     area.  If omitted, it defaults to a device-specific value (8
     pixels for X devices).

 - Function: gutter-make-button-list up &optional down disabled cap-up
          cap-down cap-disabled
     This function calls `make-glyph' on each arg and returns a list of
     the results.  This is useful for setting the first argument of a
     gutter button descriptor (typically, the result of this function
     is assigned to a symbol, which is specified as the first argument
     of the gutter button descriptor).

 - Function: check-gutter-button-syntax button &optional noerror
     Verify the syntax of entry BUTTON in a gutter description list.
     If you want to verify the syntax of a gutter description list as a
     whole, use `check-valid-instantiator' with a specifier type of
     `gutter'.

Specifying a Gutter
===================

   In order to specify the contents of a gutter, set one of the
specifier variables `default-gutter', `top-gutter', `bottom-gutter',
`left-gutter', or `right-gutter'.  These are specifiers, which means
you set them with `set-specifier' and query them with `specifier-specs'
or `specifier-instance'.  You will get an error if you try to set them
using `setq'.  The valid instantiators for these specifiers are gutter
descriptors, as described above.  *Note Specifiers::, for more
information.

   Most of the time, you will set `default-gutter', which allows the
user to choose where the gutter should go.

 - Specifier: default-gutter
     The position of this gutter is specified in the function
     `default-gutter-position'.  If the corresponding position-specific
     gutter (e.g. `top-gutter' if `default-gutter-position' is `top')
     does not specify a gutter in a particular domain, then the value
     of `default-gutter' in that domain, of any, will be used instead.

   Note that the gutter at any particular position will not be displayed
unless its thickness (width or height, depending on orientation) is
non-zero and its visibility status is true.  The thickness is controlled
by the specifiers `top-gutter-height', `bottom-gutter-height',
`left-gutter-width', and `right-gutter-width', and the visibility
status is controlled by the specifiers `top-gutter-visible-p',
`bottom-gutter-visible-p', `left-gutter-visible-p', and
`right-gutter-visible-p' (*note Other Gutter Variables::).

 - Function: set-default-gutter-position position
     This function sets the position that the `default-gutter' will be
     displayed at.  Valid positions are the symbols `top', `bottom',
     `left' and `right'.  What this actually does is set the fallback
     specifier for the position-specific specifier corresponding to the
     given position to `default-gutter', and set the fallbacks for the
     other position-specific specifiers to `nil'.  It also does the
     same thing for the position-specific thickness and visibility
     specifiers, which inherit from one of `default-gutter-height' or
     `default-gutter-width', and from `default-gutter-visible-p',
     respectively (*note Other Gutter Variables::).

 - Function: default-gutter-position
     This function returns the position that the `default-gutter' will
     be displayed at.

   You can also explicitly set a gutter at a particular position.  When
redisplay determines what to display at a particular position in a
particular domain (i.e. window), it first consults the position-specific
gutter.  If that does not yield a gutter descriptor, the
`default-gutter' is consulted if `default-gutter-position' indicates
this position.

 - Specifier: top-gutter
     Specifier for the gutter at the top of the frame.

 - Specifier: bottom-gutter
     Specifier for the gutter at the bottom of the frame.

 - Specifier: left-gutter
     Specifier for the gutter at the left edge of the frame.

 - Specifier: right-gutter
     Specifier for the gutter at the right edge of the frame.

 - Function: gutter-specifier-p object
     This function returns non-`nil' if OBJECT is a gutter specifier.
     Gutter specifiers are the actual objects contained in the gutter
     variables described above, and their valid instantiators are
     gutter descriptors (*note Gutter Descriptor Format::).


File: lispref.info,  Node: Other Gutter Variables,  Next: Common Gutter Widgets,  Prev: Specifying a Gutter,  Up: Gutter

Other Gutter Variables
======================

   The variables to control the gutter thickness, visibility status, and
captioned status are all specifiers.  *Note Specifiers::.

 - Specifier: default-gutter-height
     This specifies the height of the default gutter, if it's oriented
     horizontally.  The position of the default gutter is specified by
     the function `set-default-gutter-position'.  If the corresponding
     position-specific gutter thickness specifier (e.g.
     `top-gutter-height' if `default-gutter-position' is `top') does
     not specify a thickness in a particular domain (a window or a
     frame), then the value of `default-gutter-height' or
     `default-gutter-width' (depending on the gutter orientation) in
     that domain, if any, will be used instead.

 - Specifier: default-gutter-width
     This specifies the width of the default gutter, if it's oriented
     vertically.  This behaves like `default-gutter-height'.

   Note that `default-gutter-height' is only used when
`default-gutter-position' is `top' or `bottom', and
`default-gutter-width' is only used when `default-gutter-position' is
`left' or `right'.

 - Specifier: top-gutter-height
     This specifies the height of the top gutter.

 - Specifier: bottom-gutter-height
     This specifies the height of the bottom gutter.

 - Specifier: left-gutter-width
     This specifies the width of the left gutter.

 - Specifier: right-gutter-width
     This specifies the width of the right gutter.

   Note that all of the position-specific gutter thickness specifiers
have a fallback value of zero when they do not correspond to the
default gutter.  Therefore, you will have to set a non-zero thickness
value if you want a position-specific gutter to be displayed.

 - Specifier: default-gutter-visible-p
     This specifies whether the default gutter is visible.  The
     position of the default gutter is specified by the function
     `set-default-gutter-position'.  If the corresponding
     position-specific gutter visibility specifier (e.g.
     `top-gutter-visible-p' if `default-gutter-position' is `top') does
     not specify a visible-p value in a particular domain (a window or
     a frame), then the value of `default-gutter-visible-p' in that
     domain, if any, will be used instead.

 - Specifier: top-gutter-visible-p
     This specifies whether the top gutter is visible.

 - Specifier: bottom-gutter-visible-p
     This specifies whether the bottom gutter is visible.

 - Specifier: left-gutter-visible-p
     This specifies whether the left gutter is visible.

 - Specifier: right-gutter-visible-p
     This specifies whether the right gutter is visible.

   `default-gutter-visible-p' and all of the position-specific gutter
visibility specifiers have a fallback value of true.

   Internally, gutter thickness and visibility specifiers are
instantiated in both window and frame domains, for different purposes.
The value in the domain of a frame's selected window specifies the
actual gutter thickness or visibility that you will see in that frame.
The value in the domain of a frame itself specifies the gutter
thickness or visibility that is used in frame geometry calculations.

   Thus, for example, if you set the frame width to 80 characters and
the left gutter width for that frame to 68 pixels, then the frame will
be sized to fit 80 characters plus a 68-pixel left gutter.  If you then
set the left gutter width to 0 for a particular buffer (or if that
buffer does not specify a left gutter or has a `nil' value specified for
`left-gutter-visible-p'), you will find that, when that buffer is
displayed in the selected window, the window will have a width of 86 or

Common Gutter Widgets
=====================

   A gutter can contain arbitrary text.  So, for example, in an Info
buffer you could put the title of the current node in the top gutter,
and it would not scroll out of view in a long node.  (This is an
artificial example, since usually the node name is sufficiently
descriptive, and Info puts that in the mode line.)

   A more common use for the gutter is to hold some kind of active
widget.  The buffer-tab facility, available in all XEmacs frames,
creates an array of file-folder-like tabs, which the user can click with
the mouse to switch buffers.  W3 uses a progress-bar widget in the
bottom gutter to give a visual indication of the progress of
time-consuming operations like downloading.

Drag and Drop
*************

   _WARNING_: the Drag'n'Drop API is still under development and the
interface may change! The current implementation is considered
experimental.

   Drag'n'drop is a way to transfer information between multiple
applications.  To do this several GUIs define their own protocols.
Examples are OffiX, CDE, Motif, KDE, MSWindows, GNOME, and many more.
To catch all these protocols, XEmacs provides a generic API.

   One prime idea behind the API is to use a data interface that is
transparent for all systems. The author thinks that this is best
archived by using URL and MIME data, cause any internet enabled system
must support these for email already. XEmacs also already provides
powerful interfaces to support these types of data (tm and w3).

API.

OffiX DND
---------

   _WARNING_: If you compile in OffiX, you may not be able to use
multiple X displays successfully.  If the two servers are from
different vendors, the results may be unpredictable.

   The OffiX Drag'n'Drop protocol is part of a X API/Widget library
created by Cesar Crusius. It is based on X-Atoms and ClientMessage
events, and works with any X platform supporting them.

   OffiX is supported if 'offix is member of the variable
dragdrop-protocols, or the feature 'offix is defined.

   Unfortunately it uses it's own data types. Examples are: File, Files,
Exe, Link, URL, MIME. The API tries to choose the right type for the
data that is dragged from XEmacs (well, not yet...).

   XEmacs supports both MIME and URL drags and drops using this API. No
application interaction is possible while dragging is in progress.

http://leb.net/~offix/

CDE dt
------

   CDE stands for Common Desktop Environment. It is based on the Motif
widget library. It's drag'n'drop protocol is also an abstraction of the
Motif protocol (so it might be possible, that XEmacs will also support
the Motif protocol soon).

   CDE has three different types: file, buffer, and text. XEmacs only
uses file and buffer drags. The API will disallow full URL drags, only
file method URLs are passed through.

   Buffer drags are always converted to plain text.

Loose ends

   The following protocols will be supported soon: Xdnd, Motif, Xde (if
I get some specs), KDE OffiX (if KDE can find XEmacs windows).

   In particular Xdnd will be one of the protocols that can benefit from
the XEmacs API, cause it also uses MIME types to encode dragged data.

Drop Interface
==============

   For each activated low-level protocol, an internal routine will catch
incoming drops and convert them to a dragdrop-drop type misc-user-event.

   This misc-user-event has its function argument set to
`dragdrop-drop-dispatch' and the object contains the data of the drop
(converted to URL/MIME specific data). This function will search the
variable `experimental-dragdrop-drop-functions' for a function that can
handle the dropped data.

   To modify the drop behavior, the user can modify the variable
`experimental-dragdrop-drop-functions'. Each element of this list
specifies a possible handler for dropped data. The first one that can
handle the data will return `t' and exit. Another possibility is to set
a extent-property with the same name. Extents are checked prior to the
variable.

   The customization group `drag-n-drop' shows all variables of user
interest.

Major and Minor Modes
*********************

   A "mode" is a set of definitions that customize XEmacs and can be
turned on and off while you edit.  There are two varieties of modes:
"major modes", which are mutually exclusive and used for editing
particular kinds of text, and "minor modes", which provide features
that users can enable individually.

   This chapter describes how to write both major and minor modes, how
to indicate them in the modeline, and how they run hooks supplied by the
user.  For related topics such as keymaps and syntax tables, see *Note
Keymaps::, and *Note Syntax Tables::.

Major Modes
===========

   Major modes specialize XEmacs for editing particular kinds of text.
Each buffer has only one major mode at a time.

   The least specialized major mode is called "Fundamental mode".  This
mode has no mode-specific definitions or variable settings, so each
XEmacs command behaves in its default manner, and each option is in its
default state.  All other major modes redefine various keys and options.
For example, Lisp Interaction mode provides special key bindings for
<LFD> (`eval-print-last-sexp'), <TAB> (`lisp-indent-line'), and other
keys.

   When you need to write several editing commands to help you perform a
specialized editing task, creating a new major mode is usually a good
idea.  In practice, writing a major mode is easy (in contrast to
writing a minor mode, which is often difficult).

   If the new mode is similar to an old one, it is often unwise to
modify the old one to serve two purposes, since it may become harder to
use and maintain.  Instead, copy and rename an existing major mode
definition and alter the copy--or define a "derived mode" (*note
Derived Modes::).  For example, Rmail Edit mode, which is in
`emacs/lisp/rmailedit.el', is a major mode that is very similar to Text
mode except that it provides three additional commands.  Its definition
is distinct from that of Text mode, but was derived from it.

   Rmail Edit mode is an example of a case where one piece of text is
put temporarily into a different major mode so it can be edited in a
different way (with ordinary XEmacs commands rather than Rmail).  In
such cases, the temporary major mode usually has a command to switch
back to the buffer's usual mode (Rmail mode, in this case).  You might
be tempted to present the temporary redefinitions inside a recursive
edit and restore the usual ones when the user exits; but this is a bad
idea because it constrains the user's options when it is done in more
than one buffer: recursive edits must be exited most-recently-entered
first.  Using alternative major modes avoids this limitation.  *Note
Recursive Editing::.

   The standard XEmacs Lisp library directory contains the code for
several major modes, in files including `text-mode.el', `texinfo.el',
`lisp-mode.el', `c-mode.el', and `rmail.el'.  You can look at these
libraries to see how modes are written.  Text mode is perhaps the
simplest major mode aside from Fundamental mode.  Rmail mode is a
complicated and specialized mode.

Major Mode Conventions
----------------------

   The code for existing major modes follows various coding conventions,
including conventions for local keymap and syntax table initialization,
global names, and hooks.  Please follow these conventions when you
define a new major mode:

   * Define a command whose name ends in `-mode', with no arguments,
     that switches to the new mode in the current buffer.  This command
     should set up the keymap, syntax table, and local variables in an
     existing buffer without changing the buffer's text.

   * Write a documentation string for this command that describes the
     special commands available in this mode.  `C-h m'
     (`describe-mode') in your mode will display this string.

     The documentation string may include the special documentation
     substrings, `\[COMMAND]', `\{KEYMAP}', and `\<KEYMAP>', that
     enable the documentation to adapt automatically to the user's own
     key bindings.  *Note Keys in Documentation::.

   * The major mode command should start by calling
     `kill-all-local-variables'.  This is what gets rid of the local
     variables of the major mode previously in effect.

   * The major mode command should set the variable `major-mode' to the
     major mode command symbol.  This is how `describe-mode' discovers
     which documentation to print.

   * The major mode command should set the variable `mode-name' to the
     "pretty" name of the mode, as a string.  This appears in the mode
     line.

   * Since all global names are in the same name space, all the global
     variables, constants, and functions that are part of the mode
     should have names that start with the major mode name (or with an
     abbreviation of it if the name is long).  *Note Style Tips::.

   * The major mode should usually have its own keymap, which is used
     as the local keymap in all buffers in that mode.  The major mode
     function should call `use-local-map' to install this local map.
     *Note Active Keymaps::, for more information.

     This keymap should be kept in a global variable named
     `MODENAME-mode-map'.  Normally the library that defines the mode
     sets this variable.

   * The mode may have its own syntax table or may share one with other
     related modes.  If it has its own syntax table, it should store
     this in a variable named `MODENAME-mode-syntax-table'.  *Note
     Syntax Tables::.

   * The mode may have its own abbrev table or may share one with other
     related modes.  If it has its own abbrev table, it should store
     this in a variable named `MODENAME-mode-abbrev-table'.  *Note
     Abbrev Tables::.

   * Use `defvar' to set mode-related variables, so that they are not
     reinitialized if they already have a value.  (Such reinitialization
     could discard customizations made by the user.)

   * To make a buffer-local binding for an Emacs customization
     variable, use `make-local-variable' in the major mode command, not
     `make-variable-buffer-local'.  The latter function would make the
     variable local to every buffer in which it is subsequently set,
     which would affect buffers that do not use this mode.  It is
     undesirable for a mode to have such global effects.  *Note
     Buffer-Local Variables::.

     It's ok to use `make-variable-buffer-local', if you wish, for a
     variable used only within a single Lisp package.

   * Each major mode should have a "mode hook" named
     `MODENAME-mode-hook'.  The major mode command should run that
     hook, with `run-hooks', as the very last thing it does. *Note
     Hooks::.

   * The major mode command may also run the hooks of some more basic
     modes.  For example, `indented-text-mode' runs `text-mode-hook' as
     well as `indented-text-mode-hook'.  It may run these other hooks
     immediately before the mode's own hook (that is, after everything
     else), or it may run them earlier.

   * If something special should be done if the user switches a buffer
     from this mode to any other major mode, the mode can set a local
     value for `change-major-mode-hook'.

   * If this mode is appropriate only for specially-prepared text, then
     the major mode command symbol should have a property named
     `mode-class' with value `special', put on as follows:

          (put 'funny-mode 'mode-class 'special)

     This tells XEmacs that new buffers created while the current
     buffer has Funny mode should not inherit Funny mode.  Modes such
     as Dired, Rmail, and Buffer List use this feature.

   * If you want to make the new mode the default for files with certain
     recognizable names, add an element to `auto-mode-alist' to select
     the mode for those file names.  If you define the mode command to
     autoload, you should add this element in the same file that calls
     `autoload'.  Otherwise, it is sufficient to add the element in the
     file that contains the mode definition.  *Note Auto Major Mode::.

   * In the documentation, you should provide a sample `autoload' form
     and an example of how to add to `auto-mode-alist', that users can
     include in their `.emacs' files.

   * The top-level forms in the file defining the mode should be
     written so that they may be evaluated more than once without
     adverse consequences.  Even if you never load the file more than
     once, someone else will.

 - Variable: change-major-mode-hook
     This normal hook is run by `kill-all-local-variables' before it
     does anything else.  This gives major modes a way to arrange for
     something special to be done if the user switches to a different
     major mode.  For best results, make this variable buffer-local, so
     that it will disappear after doing its job and will not interfere
     with the subsequent major mode.  *Note Hooks::.
