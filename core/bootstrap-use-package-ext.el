  "Add post hooks to `:init' or `:config' arguments of an existing
configuration.

In order to use this macro the variable `use-package-inject-hooks'
must be non-nil.

This is useful in the dotfile to override the default configuration
of a package.

Usage:

  (use-package-add-hook package-name
     [:keyword [option]]...)

:pre-init      Code to run before the default `:init' configuration.
:post-init     Code to run after the default `:init' configuration.
:pre-config    Code to run before the default `:config' configuration.
:post-config   Code to run after the default `:config' configuration.

In practice the most useful hook is the `:post-config' where you can
override lazy-loaded settings."
