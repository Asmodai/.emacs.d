# Emacs Configuration
This is my Emacs configuration.  I have named it ZMACS.

You shouldn't really copy it unless you know your way around Emacs.

## Layout
There are two different paths under the `lisp` directory -- `zmacs` and `zlisp`.

This is so I can split up Lisp code from Emacs configuration and packages.  I
have not yet finished moving everything around to obey this layout, so some
ZMACS files are somewhat... ugly.
