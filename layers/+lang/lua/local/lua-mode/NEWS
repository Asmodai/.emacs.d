* Release rel-20130419
** highlight hash-bang line as comment

** make lua-mode-hook editable via customize

** fix several indentation bugs & quirks

** fix lua-send-proc not to send previous function when point is at the beginning of a function

** derive lua-mode from prog-mode for Emacs24

** add font-locking for builtins and numeric constants

** fix a bug causing exponential complexity in a keyword matching regexp

** add more unindentation cases for block-closing tokens

** improve multiline highlighting via font-lock-syntactic-keywords
   This should make font-locking of multiline literals more fluent & stable.  And
   it becomes customizable via standard font-lock configuration

** properly fontify variable definitions in 'local ...' & 'for ...'
   Also, perform some basic syntax verification in those lines.  Multi-line
   constructs not supported yet.

     local foo =
        {
           bar,
           baz
        }  ^
           1. these lines should be indented properly now
     ^
     2. the following lines should be unindented properly now

** extend imenu-generic-expression
   Now it matches 'foo = function(...)' function definitions
